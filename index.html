                  <h3>About PHAT</h3>
                  <p>The Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. For a hundred years, Andromeda (also known by its Messier Catalog identifier, M31) has played an important role in shaping our view of the Universe. In the early 1920's, Edwin Hubble's observations of Andromeda confirmed for the first time that galaxies lie outside of the Milky Way, and that Andromeda must contain billions of stars.</p>                  
                  
                  <p>The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey (public webpage <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat">here</a>) opens a new window on Andromeda.  This ongoing, four-year Hubble Space Telescope (HST) project will map one-third of Andomeda's spiral disk at six wavelengths ranging from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJS..200...18D">Dalcanton+ 2012</a>). The HST images have exquisite resolution, allowing PHAT to reveal more than 100 million stars by the time the survey is complete. This beautiful data set is the heart of the Andromeda Project.</p>
                
                  <div class="images">
                    <img src="images/about/footprint.jpg" />
                    <br/>
                    <span class="caption">The Andromeda galaxy with the PHAT coverage footprint overlaid (left). To the right is a small section of the PHAT data showing some of the millions of stars visible in the HST images, along with two star clusters (Image Credit: Robert Gendler &amp; Zolt Levay).</span>

                  <h3>Hunting for Stellar Clusters</h3>
                  
                  <p>Star clusters are collections of hundreds to millions of stars that were born at the same time from the same cloud of gas.  This shared origin makes star clusters unique tools for understanding how stars form and evolve.  Additionally, they are useful for studying the major chapters in the history of galaxies.  But before Andromeda's star clusters can unlock these secrets, we need the help of Citizen Scientists to <em>find</em> the clusters.  Not just the big bright ones, but the small faint ones as well.  This is the goal of the Andromeda Project.</p>                  
                  
                  <p>Star clusters vary greatly in terms of mass, size, age, and local environment.  As a result, star clusters can appear quite different from one another depending on the properties of the clusters and where they are located in the galaxy. This makes the process of identifying clusters tricky and difficult to automate. From the first year of PHAT data, a team of eight astronomers searched through each image, manually identifying star clusters by eye. Using less than 1/5th the total PHAT survey area, we cataloged about 600 star clusters (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...752...95J">Johnson+ 2012</a>). With the Andromeda Project, we hope that you will help us find the thousands of star clusters hiding in the rest of the survey!</p>
                  
                  <p>Because the appearances of star clusters vary so much, it is important for us to learn what kinds of clusters we can actually see.  For this reason, we have inserted realistic synthetic clusters with known ages, masses, and sizes into some of the PHAT images.  By identifying both real and synthetic clusters, we will learn what types of clusters are undetectable in Andromeda.  This information is critical for understanding the age and mass distributions of the clusters by allowing us to determine whether certain populations of clusters do not exist or if they are simply avoiding detection.</b></p>                  
                  
                  <p>After you help us to find these star clusters, we will use several techniques to determine the age and mass of these objects.  In some clusters, we can resolve individual stars that allow us to determine the age, mass, and other aspects of the object. In other clusters, where individual stars are too faint or too close together, we can use the summed light from a cluster to determine its properties (Fouesneau+ 2012, in prep.). With these ages and masses in hand, we can use these clusters to study a host of interesting topics: rapid and rare stages of stellar evolution, the structure and scale of star formation, the evolution of cluster populations, and how Andromeda has changed over billions of years.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Distant Galaxies Peeking Through Andromeda's Stars</h3>
                  
                  <p>Star clusters are not the only interesting things in the PHAT images.  Although Andromeda's stars dominate the images, parts of the galaxy are transparent enough that we can see distant galaxies that lie far beyond Andromeda. These "background galaxies" are excellent tools for studying the structure of Andromeda's interstellar gas and dust because they can reveal details about these dark dusty structures at small size scales.  The background galaxies can also masquerade as stellar clusters, so we need your help to carefully sort these objects.</p>

                    <h4>Identifying star clusters:</h4>
                    <p>Star clusters are the most compact groupings of stars visible in the PHAT images.  Star clusters have an amazing range of properties, ranging from scrawny newborn clusters to old massive globular clusters that are among the oldest objects known in the Universe.  In this page, you will learn how to identify star clusters.</p>

                    <p>All star clusters are dense groups of stars.  However, the exact
appearance of a star cluster depends on five factors: (1) mass; (2) angular size; (3) age; (4) dust extinction; and (5) local environment. Let's take a look how each of these influence a star cluster's appearance.</p>

                      <h4>1. Mass</h4>
                      <p>Stellar clusters have a wide range in mass.  The most massive clusters have millions of stars and are easy to find.  The least massive clusters only have a few hundred stars, and are thus difficult to spot. </p>

                       <p>The typical star cluster is about 20 light years across, which in our images is about 30 pixels. However, the full population contains clusters whose sizes differ by more than a factor of ten.  If two clusters contain the same number of stars, the cluster with a larger diameter is harder to find, because its light is spread out over a larger area.</p>

                      <p>In a very young cluster, the brightest stars will be massive blue stars. As time passes, these massive stars use up all their fuel and die, leaving only the lower mass fainter stars. Eventually, even these lower mass stars begin to die and evolve into red giants.  Old star clusters therefore appear fainter and redder than young clusters with a similar mass. </p>

                      <h4>5. Environment</h4>
                      <p>The PHAT images cover the disk of Andromeda from its busy center to its tenuous outskirts, spanning a distance of more than 50,000 light years. In the inner regions, the density of stars is extremely high, while in the outskirts the distribution of stars is much more diffuse. Exactly how easy it is to identify a cluster will depend on the density and colors of the normal "field" stars, compared to the density and colors of stars within the cluster. </p>

                    <h3 class="smaller">Tips for identifying star clusters</h3>

                    <h4>Look for the "fuzz" in the clusters</h4>
                    <p>Star clusters contain stars of many different brightnesses.  When you look at an image, you can typically only see the brightest of these stars.  Thus, even a star cluster that has only 3-4 bright stars can have hundreds of fainter ones that individually go unseen, but which blend together to form a component of diffuse unresolved light. Because of this, one reliable signature of a star cluster is an enhancement in the background light,  giving them a “fuzzy” appearance.  This fuzz may be less apparent in the more extended diffuse clusters, where more of the faint stars can be detected individually.</p>

                    <h4>Avoid "stellar associations"</h4>
                    <p>Stars are grouped together on a wide range of size scales. In addition to the small dense star clusters shown above, there are also extended "loose associations" of stars.  These associations may be star clusters that have "dissolved" as the cluster stars drifted apart, or they may be loose collections of stars that formed in the same general area, but outside of a dense stellar cluster.  Loose associations can be easily identified using automated algorithms, so in this study, we ask volunteers to ignore dispersed, un-concentrated groups of stars and focus only on the compact clusters.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="smaller">...and finally</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Known clusters</h4>
                    <p>Some of the clusters that you identify may have been found previously.  There are a number of catalogs of star clusters that have been created from lower resolution ground-based observations. These catalogs include many of the brightest clusters, but miss most of the lower mass clusters that you can identify.  We know this because in our initial work on this dataset (Johnson+ 2012), our team found up to four times as many clusters than had been previously cataloged.  <em>Most of the clusters you identify will never have been identified before.</em></p>
                  
                    <h4>Synthetic clusters</h4>

                    <p>In addition to real clusters, we have inserted some highly-realistic synthetic clusters into the images.  We use these objects to understand which kinds of clusters can be detected in the images, and which will be overlooked.  Knowledge of these limits will be essential to deriving how Andromeda's system of stellar clusters evolves over time.</p>

                    <p>Distant galaxies that lie behind Andromeda’s disk are often seen in the PHAT images. For those who have participated in Galaxy Zoo, these galaxies will look familiar. There are disky, spiral galaxies (like Andromeda) as well as rounder, smoother elliptical galaxies. We want you to identify these background galaxies in order to allow us to study the structure of dust on small scales in Andromeda.</p>

                      <p>Some of the youngest stars reach high enough temperatures that they emit very high energy ultraviolet light. This light can ionize the surrounding gas, which then glows at a number of distinct wavelengths. The glow from these "emission lines" is particularly strong in our blue image, leading to a diffuse blue nebula (see below). This nebula is known as an "HII Region" (pronounced "H-two"), because it contains ionized Hydrogen. If you see tight groups of stars associated with these blue nebulae, you should mark them as clusters.  However, not all HII regions contain or are associated with clusters, as is the case for the example presented here.</p>

                      <p>The images for this project were taken using HST’s Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instrument. This camera uses two separate CCD chips that have a small gap separating them. We fill in this gap using overlapping images, but sometimes these overlapping data do not exist, or the overlapping data are imperfectly aligned. This causes diagonal streaks in the image, but we are aware of their locations and therefore they should simply be ignored. In this image there are examples of chip gaps.</p>

                      <p>The cameras used to take the images are charge-coupled devices or CCDs. When a photon hits a pixel in these cameras, it creates a free electron. These electrons are stored in the pixel until the exposure is finished, and then the charge from each pixel is transferred to its neighboring pixels, and finally out to one corner of the chip where the electrons are converted into a digital signal. This process is typically very efficient, moving &gt;99.999% of the electrons correctly. But as the CCDs age, the pixels wear out a little, causing a little inefficiency in the way that charge is transferred. This inefficiency shows itself as small streaks in the image; some examples are shown in this image. This is especially noticeable in the least dense parts of our images.</p>
